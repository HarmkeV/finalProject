# Day 1
* Created [proposal](https://github.com/HarmkeV/finalProject/blob/master/README.md) including the notes I've gotten during the discussion     of the previous proposal
* Started assembling data; data on [religion](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2016/51/helft-nederlanders-is-kerkelijk-of-religieus) is       found and will be converted into a json file, the data regarding council seats is only available in ready made 
  [maps](https://lfverkiezingen2018.appspot.com/public/builds/f8p2ht/index.html) so i will create my own json file based on that.

# Day 2
* Created [design document](https://github.com/HarmkeV/finalProject/blob/master/DESIGN.md)
