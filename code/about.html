          <p class="description">
            The number of people who go to church or identify as a member of a religion has decreased in the last century.
            This decrease started when the pillarification (also known as 'verzuiling') of the Dutch society ended and people
            of different religions started to mingle. The end of the era of pillarifiction is characterized by the origin of
            several political parties, of which some weren't linked to a certain creed. The rate with which secularization
            exists has increased in recent years. In the history of the world, the amount of people without faith has never
            been this high. Simultaneously, the amount of political parties is Dutch society has increased, most of them not
            religious. While his has been happening simultaneously, the possible correlation of these two facts is not being
            thought at schools.

            This visualisation tries to offer an answer to the question regarding the correlation of these two events. The map
            offers an insight in secularization in the Netherlands. The pie charts display information regarding the distribution
            of seats in council and religious affiliation. The scatterplot shows an approximation of the correlation between the
            amount of seats a selected party contains and the amount of religious followers in a municipality.
